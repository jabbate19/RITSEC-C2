Jack Reinhardt: C2 Project Deliverables

DELIVERABLE 1:

What is a C2? - A C2, or 'command and control' server is a machine controlled by an attacker which is used to send commands to compromised systems and receive data from said compromised systems.

What is an agent? - An agent is a program that is run on the compromised machines to establish and maintain communications with the C2 server.

What is server/client infrastructure? - Client-Server infrastructure is an architecture of a computer network where many clients request and receive service from a single centralized server. 

A feature I would like to see is the ability to administer compromised machines via a discord bot.

I hope to learn how computers are able to interact with one another via a simple program and see how more advanced threat actors design and implement command and control servers for their campaigns.
